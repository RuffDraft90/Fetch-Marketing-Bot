# Jheryl's Workflow Feedback - Campaign Type Differentiation

## Date: July 20, 2025

## Original Feedback
> "This is so helpful!! It would benefit to be able to differentiate a general Event Campaign (i.e. what kate and karen do to actually plan the event, call vendors, work with the creative team on the visual experience, and then literally so much else to bring the physical event to life) vs what I do to invite people to the event (all of the email tickets I dropped previously.
> 
> Reason being, in monday.com I have my own parent ticket for the email campaign and kate/karen have their own parent ticket for the event itself"

## Current System Issues
- **Single unified workflow** treats everything as one campaign
- **Mixed responsibilities** under single parent ticket in Monday.com
- **No distinction** between physical event planning vs email campaigns
- Kate/Karen's event planning tasks mixed with Jheryl's email tasks

## Required Changes

### 1. Campaign Type Differentiation
- Add selector to distinguish between:
  - **Physical Event Campaign** (requires both event planning + email invitations)
  - **Email-Only Campaign** (just email workflows)

### 2. Dual Parent Ticket System
For physical events, create **two separate parent tickets**:

#### Event Planning Parent (Kate/Karen's Domain)
- Vendor coordination and calls
- Creative team collaboration for visual experience
- Physical event logistics and execution
- Event setup and operations

#### Email Campaign Parent (Jheryl's Domain)
- Email invitation workflows
- Template builds and scheduling
- Attendee communication
- RSVP management

### 3. Workflow Templates Needed
- **Event Planning Workflow** - Kate/Karen's vendor/creative/logistics tasks
- **Email Campaign Workflow** - Existing 6-subtask template for Jheryl
- **Email-Only Workflow** - Just Jheryl's workflow (no event planning)

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Dual parent ticket system in Monday.com
2. **High Priority**: Campaign type differentiation logic
3. **Medium Priority**: Campaign type selector in UI
4. **Medium Priority**: Event planning workflow template
5. **Low Priority**: Documentation updates

## Team Responsibilities

### Kate/Karen (Event Planning)
- Vendor coordination
- Creative visual experience
- Physical event logistics
- Event execution

### Jheryl (Email Campaigns)
- Email template creation
- Invitation workflows
- Attendee communication
- Email scheduling and QA

## Notes
- This feedback addresses a core workflow issue where the current system doesn't match actual team organization
- Monday.com structure should mirror real team responsibilities
- Separate parent tickets are essential for proper task organization and accountability
